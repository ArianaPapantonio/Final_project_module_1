# 🐍 Final Project Module 1 – Classic Games in Python

This project was developed by **Elena Duran Llanos**, **Ariana Papantonio**, **Macarena Peña**, and **Patricia Sainz** as part of **Module 1: Basic Python** in the **Adalab Data Analytics Bootcamp**.  
Our goal was to create **three interactive games in Python**, with a **fourth bonus game** added at the end.

## 🎮 Included Games

- **Rock, Paper, Scissors**  
  Play the classic strategy game against the computer.

- **Hangman**  
  Guess the hidden word before the full figure is drawn.

- **Trivia (Geography)**  
  Answer random geography questions correctly.

- **Tic-Tac-Toe [Bonus]**  
  A classic two-player game to get three in a row.
